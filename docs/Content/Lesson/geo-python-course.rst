Geospatial data analysis with Python
===============================================================
 
**Course Introduction**

Geospatial Data Analysis with Python is an online training course provided by GeoSpatialyst to teach you how to programmatically analyze geospatial data with Python. The course consists of six interactive sessions starting from learning general operations on geometric features to analyzing satellite images (i.e. reading and writing raster formats). In this course, students will mostly sit in front of computer since they will learn to program and do pratical exercises in Python language alongside with the course convener. We will focus on applying programming skills to do various tasks without using any tool in GIS but producing the same or better result and faster than GIS.

**Course Requirement**

To gain the most from the course, it’s necessary to know the basics of ArcGIS or QGIS and Python programming. You don’t need to be very good at it, but at least you should know the main files in GIS such as vector or raster files and have little experience in Python. If you are new to Python, you might find it a bit difficult to follow the lessons, but it doesn’t mean you can’t take this course because you’ll never know until you try.

**Course Environment**

In this online course, we will use JupyterLab, a web-based user interface, as the main programming environment. It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb-files), text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. All of the code materials in this course are in .ipynb-files which you can run in JupyterLab on your own computer.

**Course Objectives**

In this course, you will learn from the basic level of using Python for geospatial data analysis to advanced level of analyzing the satellite image retrieved from dataset in Google Earth Engine. In each session, you are supposed to gain the following knowledge:
